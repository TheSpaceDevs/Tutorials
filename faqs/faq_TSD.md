## APIs

### Which APIs are available?

*The Space Devs* currently handles and provides two APIs first-hand:

- [Launch Library 2 (LL2)](https://thespacedevs.com/llapi) : Launch Library 2 is a REST API for rocket launch data. As
  the official successor of the original Launch Library API, which it replaced in 2020, it keeps its core features
  whilst also including everything the broader Space Launch Now API had to offer. The result is a large database
  delivering a more complete experience for each rocket launch and space event. Since 2021, all orbital rocket launches
  since Sputnik-1 in 1957 are included in the database.

  A complete list of features and documentation links are available on the TSD
  website [here](https://thespacedevs.com/llapi). A dedicated FAQ is available [here](faq_LL2.md).


- [Spaceflight News API (SNAPI)](https://thespacedevs.com/snapi) : The Spaceflight News API is a REST API that provides
  space news articles, which are automatically detected. These are then manually linked to relevant Launch
  Library 2 `launch` and `event` objects, allowing for *related-news* sections on launch and event pages or *view
  launch* and *view event* links on news articles.

  A complete list of features and documentation links are available on the TSD
  website [here](https://thespacedevs.com/snapi). A dedicated FAQ is available [here](faq_SNAPI.md).

Two other APIs are provided by TSD partners :

- [Launch Dashboard API (LDAPI)](https://github.com/shahar603/Launch-Dashboard-API) : The Launch Dashboard API is an
  Open Source
  REST API of rocket launch telemetry. All the data is acquired through optical character recognition (OCR) of launch
  webcasts. The data is then processed by a physics simulator, filtered to remove anomalies and annotated before
  becoming available to API requests.

  More information about the API and can be found on the GitHub
  repository [here](https://github.com/shahar603/Launch-Dashboard-API).


- [Flight Club API](https://flightclub.io) : The Flight Club API is a REST API providing access to flight club data and
  calculators.

  You can find more information about Flight Club [here](https://flightclub.io) and the API
  documentation [here](https://api.flightclub.io/swagger-ui.html).
